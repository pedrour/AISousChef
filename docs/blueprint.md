# **App Name**: AI Sous Chef

## Core Features:

- Photo Analysis: Allow users to upload an image of ingredients and use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model to identify the ingredients in the photo.
- Ingredient Input: Provide a text input area where users can manually input a list of ingredients.
- Recipe Generation (Photo): Generate a recipe using AI based on the ingredients identified from the photo analysis tool. If possible the LLM should be used as a tool to decide which step to include from a set of candidate steps.
- Recipe Generation (Text): Generate a recipe using AI based on the ingredients inputted via text, prioritizing those ingredients.
- Recipe Display: Display the generated recipe with a Recipe Name, clear list of ingredients, and numbered step-by-step instructions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy orange (#C45500) to evoke warmth and appetite.
- Background color: Cream (#FAF2E6), a desaturated, bright tint of the primary color, for a clean and appetizing backdrop.
- Accent color: Olive green (#7A9D49), for complementary contrast.
- Body text: 'Literata' serif with a literary, vintage, slightly formal feel. Headline text: 'Literata' - same font to create consistency.
- Use minimalist icons related to cooking ingredients, preparation steps. All line-based style.
- Clean and modern layout, focus on readability. Photo input, text input, and output recipe clearly separated. The instructions will be formatted as an ordered list.
- Subtle animations when the recipe is generated, like fading in or sliding from the bottom, with consideration to keep things very minimalist.
